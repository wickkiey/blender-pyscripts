# Generated 3D Models Output Directory

This directory stores 3D models generated by the TRELLIS Gradio application.

## File Naming Convention

Generated files follow this pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.{glb|obj}
```

Example:
- `20240930_143022_red_dragon.glb`
- `20240930_143100_from_image.obj`

## Supported Formats

### GLB (Recommended)
- **Extension**: `.glb`
- **Description**: GL Transmission Format Binary
- **Benefits**: Single file, includes textures and materials
- **Best for**: Direct import into Blender

### OBJ
- **Extension**: `.obj` (+ `.mtl` for materials)
- **Description**: Wavefront 3D format
- **Benefits**: Universal support, easy to edit
- **Best for**: Compatibility and modification

## Usage

### Import into Blender

**Method 1 - Manual**:
1. Open Blender
2. File → Import → glTF 2.0 (.glb) or Wavefront (.obj)
3. Navigate to this directory
4. Select your model file

**Method 2 - Automatic** (Recommended):
1. Open Blender
2. Go to Scripting workspace
3. Open `model_viewer_blender.py`
4. Set `MODEL_PATH` to your file in this directory
5. Run script (Alt+P)

## Cleaning Up

Models can be safely deleted when no longer needed. The directory will be automatically recreated by the Gradio app.

To clean up old models:
```bash
# Delete models older than 7 days
find outputs/ -name "*.glb" -o -name "*.obj" -mtime +7 -delete

# Or manually delete specific files
rm outputs/old_model.glb
```

## File Size

Typical sizes:
- Simple objects: 100KB - 2MB
- Complex models: 2MB - 20MB
- Very detailed: 20MB - 100MB+

Large files may take longer to load in Blender.

## Notes

- This directory is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- Models are not automatically backed up
- Keep important models in a separate location
- Consider compressing models for archival: `tar -czf models.tar.gz outputs/`
